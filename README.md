# RadCode

Repository for example code.

## Problems

Featuring problems from LeetCode and Kattis that I solved in one or multiple ways. Besides solutions, each problem will contain a description, tests and a technical explanation of the solution in plain English. I believe good testing and technical writing skills are imperative to good software development.

## Projects

Featuring projects of my own. While the problems are meant to illustrate the code I write on a micro-level, these projects will hopefully attest to my competence on the macro-level, working towards a larger goal while maintaining more code.
